# CREST 2023 - 6th Workshop on Formal Reasoning about Causation, Responsibility, & Explanations in Science & Technology

## About
The CREST workshop series center around the development of formal approaches to reasoning about causation in software and systems. The topics of formally identifying the cause(s) of specific events - usually some form of failures -, explaining why they occurred, and predicting certain outcomes are increasing in the focus of several, disjoint communities.

The main objective of CREST is to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia in order to enable discussions on how causal inference and causal prediction is performed. A further objective is to link to the foundations of causal reasoning in the philosophy of sciences and to causal reasoning performed in computer science and engineering.

CREST 2023 will take place on 23 April, as a satellite event of ETAPS 2023.
